<p> I don't have many acomplishments in terms of science but the reason I placed it as my intrest page is due to my complete fascination with the topic! </p>
<p> Somebody I would like to highlight from the world of science is Neil Degrasse Tyson, He is a well known astrophysicist, author, and science communicator. I found him through his well known podcast 
named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarTalk">Star Talk</a> where his focus is all types of science being shared with the world! I find myself listen to his podcast due to the way he composes his ideas and how easy it is to access his media. </p>

<p> My first exposures to the world of science was through school, though my thoughts on school was low at the time I always found myself looking forward to the science portion of the day. This grew to 
an even larger hobby of mine. Unlike my other hobbies like art and wrestling I can find myself enjoying science even when tired after a long day.</p>	  
<p> The reason I am so captivated by science is due to it's evidence based nature and the way it answers my questions about the world around me! It's very similar to ideas like religion but it folllows 
all ideas with evidence that can make sense practically and mathmaticlly. It is also easy to find your level of knowledge and expand on it with simple youtube videos, podcasts, and books which I find 
myself browsing very frequently. </p>
